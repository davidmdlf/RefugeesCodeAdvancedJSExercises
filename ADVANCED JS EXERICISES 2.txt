1. Implement a function that counts from a number given by parameter, to another number given as second parameter.
	It should print in console every number between both of them. Tip: recursion is a good friend

2. Implement a function that calculates the result of a number raised to the power of a second number.
 It should receives two parameters:
   - A number that is going to be the base
   - Another number that is going to be the power to elevate to (exponent)
 Tip: a number raised to a power is that number multiplied by itself many times as the second number indicates

3. Implement a constructor for a class called Student. The constructor should receive the next parameters:
	- name. A string
	- age. A number
	- academicRecord. An object with the following attributes:
		- maths. As value, set a number (the number that you want between 0 and 100)
		- literature. As value, set a number (the number that you want between 0 and 100)
		- science. As value, set a number (the number that you want between 0 and 100).
	Use the constructor to create an object and store it in a variable.
	Then, use console.log to show the information of the student and the grade in science. It should result on something like this:
		"David (33) has a grade of 100 in science"

4. In the constructor, you can define as attributes of the class some functions that works with the information in the class.
In this exercise, you have to define a function inside the class Student that receives as parameter the name of a subject
and prints the same message than in the previous exercise. If the subject that receives is not a valid subject, it should
show a message to inform it. Defines the function as an arrow function.
